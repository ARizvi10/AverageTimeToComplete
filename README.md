Overview
Task Time Tracker is a simple yet effective program that helps users estimate how long a task will take based on their personal work habits. By tracking the amount of time spent on a task each day, the program calculates the average daily time investment and projects the number of days required to complete similar tasks in the future.

Features
Input daily time spent on a task

Track how many days have passed

Calculate average time spent per day

Estimate how many days a task will take to complete based on this average

How It Works
The user inputs the time (in hours, minutes, etc.) they spend on a task each day.

The program keeps track of how many days have passed since tracking began.

It calculates the average time spent on the task per day.

When given a total estimated task time, the program can estimate how many more days are needed to complete the task based on the user's past average.

Example Use Case
Imagine you're writing a research paper. You log how long you spend writing each day:

Day 1: 2 hours

Day 2: 1.5 hours

Day 3: 2.5 hours

The program calculates your average as 2 hours per day. If you estimate the paper will take 10 hours total, the program predicts it will take you approximately 5 days to finish.
